As of 2025-09-22, the SIDD v1.0.0 documents are available on the NSG standards registry, however there is only a single
link for schema files which contains v3.0.0.

The files in this folder were instead copied from:
https://github.com/ngageoint/six-library/tree/448e6d659bb4b650fcc19e4b909353203c3a5195/six/modules/c%2B%2B/six.sidd/conf/schema

which are largely similar to those in:
https://github.com/ngageoint/sarpy/tree/abbd570dbb6c8ccfde91b22def8b0365b45856da/sarpy/io/product/sidd_schema/version1

with exceptions being apparent fixes in `SFA.xsd` and `SICommonTypes.xsd`.
